securityDefinitions:
  Bearer:
    type: apiKey
    name: Authorization
    in: header
    description: |
      JWT Authorization header using the Bearer scheme.
      
      **Format:** `Bearer {jwt_token}`
      
      **Example:** `Bearer eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9...`
      
      **How to obtain token:**
      1. Make a POST request to `/login` with valid credentials
      2. Copy the `access_token` from the response
      3. Add it to the Authorization header as `Bearer {access_token}`
      
      **Token contains:**
      - User identity and role information
      - Expiration time (typically 24 hours)
      - Permissions and access level
      
      **Usage:**
      - Include this header in requests to protected endpoints
      - Token will be validated on each request
      - Expired tokens will return 401 Unauthorized
  
  JWTAuth:
    type: apiKey
    name: Authorization
    in: header
    description: |
      JSON Web Token (JWT) authentication for API access.
      
      **Authentication Flow:**
      1. **Login:** POST credentials to `/login` endpoint
      2. **Token:** Receive JWT access token in response
      3. **Header:** Include token in Authorization header
      4. **Access:** Make authenticated requests to protected resources
      
      **Token Security:**
      - Cryptographically signed for integrity
      - Contains encoded user claims and permissions
      - Automatically expires for security (configurable TTL)
      - Stateless - no server-side session storage required
      
      **Error Responses:**
      - `401 Unauthorized`: Missing, invalid, or expired token
      - `403 Forbidden`: Valid token but insufficient permissions

      description: |
        Update member information and preferences with comprehensive validation.
        
        **Purpose:**
        - Update member profile information selectively
        - Change membership type and billing preferences
        - Modify contact information and address
        - Update account preferences and settings
        - Maintain audit trail of changes
        
        **Features:**
        - Partial updates (only send fields to change)
        - Input validation for all fields
        - Email uniqueness verification (if email updated)
        - Password encryption (if password updated)
        - Membership type validation
        - Preference management
        
        **Security:** 
        - Requires valid JWT authentication
        - Members can update own profile
        - Admin/Manager can update any member
        - Sensitive operations require elevated permissions
        
        **Process:**
        1. Validate JWT token and member permissions
        2. Verify member exists and is accessible
        3. Validate input payload structure
        4. Check email availability (if email changed)
        5. Encrypt new password securely (if provided)
        6. Update member record with changes
        7. Return updated member details
        
        **Rate Limiting:** 5 updates per minute per member
        **Audit:** All updates are logged for security

            **Partial Updates Supported:**
            - Send only the fields you want to update
            - Omitted fields will remain unchanged
            - Empty/null values will be ignored
            
            **Field Validation:**
            - Email must be unique across all members
            - Password must meet security requirements (8+ chars)
            - Membership type must be valid enum value
            - Phone number format validation applied
            
            **Security Notes:**
            - New passwords are automatically encrypted
            - Sensitive fields require elevated permissions
            - All changes are audit logged
